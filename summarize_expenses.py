summarize_expenses.py
----------------------

This script reads the ``expenses.txt`` file produced by the Java
ExpenseTracker application and prints a simple summary of total
amounts spent per category. It is a convenience script so you can
quickly see where your money is going without having to run the
interactive Java program.

Usage:
    python3 summarize_expenses.py

It will look for ``expenses.txt`` in the current working directory.
If the file does not exist, it will print a message and exit.
